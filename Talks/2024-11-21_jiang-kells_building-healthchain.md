### Abstract

Generative AI has the potential to improve care and increase productivity within the NHS, especially when integrated in existing workflows. However, getting started on projects like these can be complex and time-consuming, requiring expertise in both AI and healthcare systems.

In this talk I will introduce HealthChain, an open-source Python framework that makes it easy to prototype and test AI/NLP applications that integrate with electronic health record (EHR) systems by providing sandbox environments for end-to-end pipeline and integration testing without having to deal with the intricacies of backend APIs and data configurations. I will also discuss how this will help us build reactive, reproducible, and scalable systems in health beyond initial proof-of-concepts.
